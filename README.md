#Countdown Solver

###Functionality
Based on the UK television program Countdown, contestants are given 9 random letters and they have to come up with words that use as many letters as possible.

This program, when given 9 letters outputs all words that satisfy the letters given, with words increasing in letters used ascendingly. 

###Current state
The Java implementation is currently working, compile both classes and run the Countdown class. You will be prompted to enter 9 letters. The program will then output all words in the text file supplied that satisfy the given letters.

The C++ implementation is still a work in progress.

###Problems
The text file is taken from the word list supplied with Linux Mint, it could be more thorough and does lack anglicised words.
